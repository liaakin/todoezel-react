ToDoeZel â€“ React/Next.js 

A responsive task management application built with React.js and Next.js. It extends the original Vanilla JS version with new features, reusable components, global state management, and a clean, motivating design.

The app helps users organize their tasks, notes, and shopping items with features like progress tracking, date-based reminders, and persistent storage.
